My name is ______ and I am writing to encourage you to help provide the green light for the next Psych movie, Psych 4. <br>


This fan base is an amazing community that has continued strong for almost 20 years. We have a regular podcast hosted by two main stars from the show that integrate writers, cast members and fans.  <br>


We have 2 separate Psych fan events. One is a fan lead event that has hosted 2 events already with its 3rd planned for this August. Also, there have been 2 large Psych conventions that have had cast signing, panels, pictures, and interactive events. <br>


We, as fans of the show, continue to back the cast and writers as they have created 3 amazing movies following the 8 seasons of the show. However, we also know there are more to the story to share. Also, we know that the script for Psych 4 has already been greenlighted by Peacock. <br>


Therefore, it is with this email, we ask for continued support when it comes to Psych 4.<br>

Thank you,</p>

My name is ___. I have been a Psych fan since __, and have been a Peacock subscriber since __. I’m considering dropping my subscription because there still hasn’t been an announcement for the 4th Psych movie. The last update we received was that the script has been greenlit. All we need is for the actual filming to be greenlit as well! I know that a 4th Psych movie would keep me on as a subscriber and would undoubtably get you new subscribers from all the other Psych-Os out there waiting.<br>

Please announce Psych 4 soon! The large and active fan base is counting on you!<br>

Sincerely,
                </p>

My name is ___. I have been a Psych fan since __. I currently do not subscribe to Peacock. However, I would happily subscribe if you announced a 4th Psych movie. The last update we received was that the script has been greenlit. All we need is for the actual filming to be greenlit as well! If you announce Psych 4, not only would you gain my subscription, but it would undoubtably get you new subscribers from all the other Psych-Os out there waiting.<br>

By this email, I wish to ask you to greenlight Psych 4. <br>

Since 2021, the Psych-Os have been waiting for the next movie and to see the entire cast together on screen again.
Psych-Os is a large fanbase, an international one, ready to participate in a lot of Psych related stuff: Podcast, convention, game night... a new movie would be a highlight for us. <br>
We need to know the name of baby Guster. We need to see Karen’s husband. We want to see the whole gang back together. Psych makes us laugh and makes us happy, so we are asking you to bring it back. <br>

We are counting on you.<br>
Have a great day.<br></p>

                    Psych has a very committed fan base from all over the world and we want to be able to see our favorite characters back together.<br>

                    Next year Psych will have its 20th anniversary and we would love to celebrate with a new movie.<br>
                    We love and support everyone in the psych cast and crew and love anything Psych related like the podcast, conventions and game nights. <br>
                    Getting a new movie would make many of us suscribe to Peacock so we can see the new content.<br>
                    Thank you so much for your time,<br>
